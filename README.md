The project utilizes statistical analysis to evaluate Shaquille O'Neal's NBA career performance. By analyzing a detailed dataset of 1,207 records with 32 variables, the project aims to predict game outcomes, such as wins/losses, free throws, game points, and fouls, using other performance indicators. Key objectives include examining the relationships between minutes played, games played, win/loss outcomes, opponent teams, free throws, assists, steals, blocks, personal fouls, and game scores. The methodology involves using R programming for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and creating visualizations with packages like ggplot2 and dplyr. The project provides insights into how personal fouls and rebounds affect points scored, aiding decision-making and reducing negative outcomes in future games.
